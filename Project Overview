The objective of the " NetPath Illuminator" project is to integrate practical networking lab experiences with the creation of an innovative tool that allows students to explore the packet flow through various network devices and topologies as well as, if possible, extend the vision to create a tool which can provide the Real-Time Packet Journey as well as allow users to query the network events.
This tool aims to create a real-time graphical representation of how data packets travel from their source to destination, navigating through the layers of a network, and highlighting the interactions with switches, routers, and across different subnet boundaries. 
The project will synthesize the learning objectives from the seven networking labs/Levels into the development of a comprehensive system. Students will be able to input their network configurations and observe the dynamic journey of packets as they cross various network segments.
